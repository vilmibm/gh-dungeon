# gh-dungeon
an incomplete idea

for a hack day, i wanted to experiment with "walking" around a repository in a different manner than `gh repo garden`. Instead of a top-down visual representation, I wanted a text adventure style dungeon.

This code maps a repository's directory structure to a navigable dungeon. it's buffy (you can't actually look at files yet). I half-finished the ability to also traverse through time by "shifting" SHAs forward and backwards.

I wanted to include flavor generation based on hashed repository attributes, inventory, and perhaps a threat of some kind but didn't get there; this foundation can be built on, though.
